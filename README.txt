Running the Server (both CP1 and CP2):
Change the static variables privateKeyPath and serverCertPath to the absolute paths of your private key file and cert file accordingly. A .der file is used for the private key to convert it to a PrivateKey type.

Running the Client:
Change the filepath and filename variables to the absolute filepath of the file you want to transfer and the filename of the file respectively. Change the variable CACSEcrtpath to the absolute path of the CA's cert.
